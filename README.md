# JavaScript Modelling Framework (JSMF)

## Description

JSMF is a set of tool for model management in javascript, which can either be

The library is composed of the following components:

- *jsmf-core*: The core library, to define model and model instances.
- *jsmf-jstl*: A library for iJSMF model transformations.
- *jsmf-magellan*: A library for model navigation and model queries.
- *jsmf-neo4J*: A NEO4J backend for JSMF models.
- *jsmf-json*: Serialization of jsmf models as JSON.
- *jsmf-util*: Miscellanous functions for jsmf models.
- *jsmf-yuml* : A utility library for JSMF to provide a yUML ouput for JSMF metamodels.

Aside these libraries, the examples folders contains some example about the
global usage of the libraries.
