# JSMF documentation

JSMF is a model management tool in javascript.

## Install

The easiest way is to use `npm` to obtain `jsmf`. You can either
`npm install jsmf` to obtain the all-in-one library or install only the jsmf
part you need. For example, if you only want to describe a model
`npm install jsmf-core` is sufficient.

The available libraries (with a short description is available in the [libraries page](./chapter/libraries.md).
